# Evaluating Navigation Techniques for Virtual Reality Museums

Group project developed for the Virtual Reality course at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico in 2024/25.

## Introduction

This project explores navigation in virtual reality (VR) museum environments, focusing on improving user performance, spatial awareness, and preferences. Navigation, encompassing locomotion and wayfinding, is crucial for intuitive and engaging user experiences. While VR navigation in outdoor settings is well-studied, navigating complex indoor environments like museums remains underexplored.

We evaluated three distinct navigation methods within a virtual museum:
1. **2D Non-Interactive Map:** A static and simplistic representation.
2. **3D Non-Interactive Map:** A scaled 3D model offering spatial context but lacking interactivity.
3. **3D Interactive Map (World-in-Miniature):** A dynamic and interactive solution allowing users to point-and-teleport.

## Research Question (RQ)

**How do 2D maps, non-interactive 3D maps, and interactive 3D maps impact navigation effectiveness, spatial awareness, and user preferences in VR museums?**

To answer this, 35 participants completed tasks using each navigation method. Their performance was measured through:
- **Objective metrics:** Task completion times.
- **Subjective metrics:** System Usability Scale (SUS), perceived complexity, and user preferences.

## Key Findings

- The **3D Interactive Map** demonstrated superior performance in navigation efficiency, usability, and user preferences.
- The **2D Map**, while familiar, was the least effective due to its limited functionality.
- The **3D Non-Interactive Map** offered better spatial awareness than the 2D Map but lacked the interactivity of the 3D Interactive Map.
- Minimal motion sickness was reported, with no significant differences between methods.

These findings highlight the importance of interactivity in VR navigation systems, providing valuable insights for optimizing virtual museum experiences and similar indoor environments.
